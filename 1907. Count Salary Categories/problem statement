SQL Query to Categorize Bank Accounts by Income

Problem Statement
We have a database table named Accounts that stores information about bank accounts and their monthly income.

Objective
Write an SQL query to classify bank accounts into three salary categories based on their monthly income and count the number of accounts in each category.

Salary Categories
Low Salary: income < 20000
Average Salary: income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 (inclusive)
High Salary: income > 50000
The result table should always include all three categories, even if a category has zero accounts.

Explanation
"Low Salary" category includes account 2 with an income of 12747.
"Average Salary" category has no accounts in the range [20000, 50000], so the count is 0.
"High Salary" category includes accounts 3, 6, and 8, as their incomes are greater than 50000.

Constraints
Each account_id is unique.
The result should include all three salary categories, even if some have zero accounts.
